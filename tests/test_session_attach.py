"""Attaching to a LIVE runtime -- the endpoint, the fan-out, the stale break.

``serve --attach <ref>`` used to *resume* a session: it booted a second
``RealRuntime`` over the same session id. If the first process was still
running, that was two live runtimes appending to one ``ui-events.jsonl``. The
lease stops two *clients* interleaving input; nothing stopped two *processes*
interleaving transcript.

:mod:`~amplifier_runtime.kernel.session_attach` makes the owner advertise a
socket and the newcomer join it instead. The cross-process proof lives in
``tests/test_session_control_multiprocess.py``; this file pins the mechanism
underneath it, and in particular the two ways it could quietly fail: believing
a *stale* advert (a hard-killed owner would make a session look permanently
occupied) and *not* believing a live one (which is the double-writer).
