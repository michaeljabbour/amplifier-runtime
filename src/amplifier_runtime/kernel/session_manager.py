"""Store-level session lifecycle ops: rename / delete / cleanup / branch.

The interactive slash commands ``/model`` … act on the LIVE coordinator
(:mod:`~amplifier_runtime.kernel.session_ops`). THIS module is the
sibling for the *stored* session: the operations amplifier-app-cli
exposes as ``amplifier session <verb>`` (``commands/session.py``) and the
in-session ``/rename`` / ``/branch`` family (``ui/command_sessions.py``,
``ui/core_commands.py``). Re-expressed here over tui's own
:class:`~amplifier_runtime.kernel.persistence.SessionStore` — no
amplifier-app-cli import, no vendored code.

Everything is a plain function over a ``SessionStore`` so it unit-tests
against a tmp-dir store with no coordinator, no Textual and no runtime
thread. Nothing here touches the developer's real ``~/.amplifier`` unless
handed a default-constructed store; tests and probes always pass an
explicit scratch ``base_dir``.

Behavioral contract (donor parity):

- **resolve** — a partial id resolves to exactly one full id
  (:meth:`SessionStore.find_session`): ``FileNotFoundError`` on no match,
  ``ValueError`` on an ambiguous prefix.
- **rename** — writes ``name`` (clamped to :data:`MAX_NAME_LENGTH`) plus a
  ``name_generated_at`` stamp into ``metadata.json`` via
  :meth:`SessionStore.update_metadata`. The name must match
  :data:`NAME_PATTERN` (letters / digits / space / ``. - _``).
- **delete** — removes the whole ``sessions/<id>/`` tree.
- **cleanup** — removes top-level sessions older than *days*.
- **branch** — snapshots a message list into a NEW top-level session id
  carrying ``parent_id`` provenance (the persisted-fork analog of the
  in-memory ``/rewind``).

session must be labeled, never dropped or shown as if it were healthy).

Two independent axes are folded into one field: whether ``metadata.json``
parses, and whether the transcript/index backing it is intact. Only
``ok``/``recovered``/``corrupt`` were surfaced originally; ``transcript_lost``
and ``indexing`` (S2 gap 3, "explicit indexing states") close the gap
between those two extremes for shapes that are genuinely detectable from
the files ``SessionStore`` already reads for a listing -- no state here is
inferred or guessed at:

- ``"ok"`` -- metadata parsed normally AND (when metadata exists) the
  transcript is readable. This also covers a brand-new session with no
  ``metadata.json`` yet and nothing written -- that is a normal, not a
  damaged, state.
- ``"recovered"`` -- ``metadata.json`` (and its ``.backup``) existed but
  neither could be parsed; :meth:`~amplifier_runtime.kernel.persistence.
  SessionStore._load_metadata` already substitutes a synthetic
  ``{"recovered": True, ...}`` shell rather than raising, but nothing
  upstream surfaced that marker until now.
- ``"corrupt"`` -- building the summary itself raised past that recovery;
  :func:`list_summaries` catches it at the per-session boundary so one bad
  directory cannot take down the whole listing.
- ``"transcript_lost"`` -- metadata parsed cleanly (name/bundle/turns are
  all trustworthy), but ``transcript.jsonl`` (and its ``.backup``, if any)
  EXISTED and neither parsed -- :meth:`~amplifier_runtime.kernel.
  persistence.SessionStore.transcript_ok` reuses the exact recovery probe
  a real resume runs. The conversation history is gone; the session's
  identity is not. Unlike ``recovered``/``corrupt``, this state is still
  resumable (see :data:`RESUMABLE_STATES`) -- the runtime already resumes
  it today with an empty restored history plus a loud warning
  (``kernel/runtime.py``'s ``transcript_recovery_failed`` notice); this
  just stops the listing from hiding that fact behind a plain ``ok``.
- ``"indexing"`` -- the OPPOSITE asymmetry: ``transcript.jsonl`` has real
  content (``_message_count`` > 0) but ``metadata.json`` does not exist as
  a file at all -- not "recovered" (which requires a file that failed to
  parse), genuinely absent. Every code path that writes a session
  (:meth:`~amplifier_runtime.kernel.persistence.SessionStore.save`) writes
  the transcript then the metadata in the same call, so this shape is the
  detectable fingerprint of a save interrupted mid-way (a session still
  being indexed/cataloged) or a directory populated by something other
  than this app. Name/bundle/turn count are genuinely unknown, not merely
  unparsed -- there is nothing to resume into (:data:`RESUMABLE_STATES`
  excludes it, matching :func:`resolve_for_resume`'s pre-existing
  no-metadata-at-all refusal).
