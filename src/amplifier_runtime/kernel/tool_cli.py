"""Governance gate for the one-shot ``tool invoke`` CLI (ADR-0007 resolution 1).

The interactive TUI gates every tool call on ``tool:pre`` through
:class:`~amplifier_runtime.kernel.governance_hook.GovernanceHook`, which can
*ask* the human at the approval bar. A scriptable ``amplifier-tui tool
invoke`` runs in a one-shot, non-interactive context: there is no approval bar
to answer, so an ``ask`` outcome cannot be satisfied. Rather than silently drop
that gate (an ungated bypass around the very protections the app enforces
in-session), this module resolves the SAME trust posture the TUI would and
refuses anything that is not an outright ``allow`` -- fail-safe by construction.

Two postures, both reusing :mod:`amplifier_runtime.model.trust`:

- **safe (default):** ``build`` -- read/test auto-allow; write/net/spend/exec
  resolve to ``ask`` and are therefore refused (no one to ask).
- **write (``--yes``):** ``auto`` -- read/write/test auto-allow (writes still
  clear the directory write-boundary via :func:`~.safety.resolve_safety`);
  net/spend/exec stay classifier-gated and are refused.

The offline classifier is deliberately NOT consulted here: it authorizes
against ambient user intent (the run's prompt history), and a bare CLI invoke
has none, so a classifier-gated capability fails safe to a refusal instead of
being waved through. Out-of-project writes are blocked by the directory policy
exactly as they are in-session.
