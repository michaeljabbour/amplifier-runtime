"""Hooks → asyncio.Queue[UIEvent] bridge.

Hook handlers must return fast (RESEARCH-BRIEF §2): this bridge does the
minimum — normalize the raw payload at the one boundary
(:func:`kernel.events.normalize`) and ``put_nowait`` the typed event.
The Textual app consumes the queue on its own loop and throttles paints;
nothing here blocks the engine.
