"""Real provider verification for preflight (S4 AC4 follow-up).

:mod:`kernel.preflight` proves the mount/provider PLAN resolves. This module
proves the PRIORITY provider (the one that will actually serve the first
turn -- ``preflight._priority_provider_entry``) does three additional,
concrete things before Textual takes the screen:

1. **Real provider mounting** -- the module actually imports and its
   ``mount()`` produces an object satisfying ``amplifier_core.interfaces
   .Provider`` (:func:`verify_provider`, via the mount step below).
2. **Credential viability** -- every environment variable the provider's
   OWN ``get_info()`` declares (``ProviderInfo.credential_env_vars`` --
   authoritative, not a guessed ``<X>_API_KEY`` convention) is present and
   non-blank (:func:`_check_credentials`).
3. **Selected-model availability** -- the configured/default model is at
   least a real, non-blank selection by default; whether it actually
   EXISTS for the provider is verified only when asked
   (:func:`_check_model`).

Offline/network boundary (read this before changing the defaults)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Checks 1 and 2 are **always on and offline**: importing a module and
calling its ``mount()`` touches no network (providers construct SDK
clients lazily -- the wire is only touched on the first real
``complete()``/``list_models()`` call), and checking ``os.environ`` for a
variable NAME is a dict lookup. Both run on every launch without
measurably slowing it down.

Check 3 has a genuine offline/online split. Confirming a model STRING
was selected is free; confirming it EXISTS for the provider means asking
the provider (``Provider.list_models()``, whose own docstring says the
provider may implement it via "API query, hardcoded list, cached
response, etc." -- so from preflight's vantage point it must be treated
as potentially networked). ``kernel.setup.list_provider_models`` already
treats it exactly this way (a mandatory timeout, "app-cli has none, but a
TUI must not sit on a wedged socket"). So: the static/default tier never
calls it; the live tier does, opt-in only (``live_verify=True``), bounded
by ``live_timeout``. Strict diagnostics (``strict=True``) additionally
fail closed when the returned catalog is empty: that result cannot prove
an explicit model override is valid, and a doctor command must not call
an inconclusive probe "ready". A live check also doubles as an authentic
credential-acceptance probe (an invalid key surfaces as a real 401 from
``list_models()``), so there is no separate networked "is this key
accepted" probe for check 2 -- it would just re-pay the same round trip
for the same signal.

The import-failure boundary
----------------------------
A provider module can fail to import for two very different reasons that
look identical from the outside:

* its OWN third-party dependency (the SDK) is not pip-installed yet,
  because this preflight -- like the real boot's OWN prior resolution
  step -- deliberately runs with ``install_deps=False`` (see
  ``kernel/preflight.py`` module docstring); the very next thing that
  happens on a successful preflight is the real launch's
  ``resolve_config(..., install_deps=True)``, which installs it for real.
  Hard-failing here would block a launch that was about to self-heal.
* the module (or its bundle source) is simply broken/misconfigured --
  exactly the silent, post-takeover failure this whole feature exists to
  catch.

:func:`_degrades_gracefully` tells these apart using the failing
import's ``.name``: only a MISSING TRANSITIVE dependency (not the bundle
module's own top-level package, nor any of its submodules) degrades. This
mirrors ``kernel.setup.ensure_provider_available``, which resolves the
identical ambiguity in the onboarding wizard by *not* installing and
tolerating "not available" rather than blocking ("app-cli shells out to
``uv pip install -e``; persisting ``source:`` ... is enough, because the
next session boot has foundation install it properly").

A THIRD shape hides inside "the module ... is simply broken/
misconfigured": the bundle module's own top-level package, or one of its
submodules, can exist on disk and import successfully on its own, yet the
bundle module still fails because it asks that submodule for a name it
doesn't define (e.g. ``__init__.py`` doing ``from .utils import Foo`` when
``utils.py`` exists but has no ``Foo``). Python raises a plain
``ImportError`` for that -- not ``ModuleNotFoundError`` -- because
``ModuleNotFoundError`` (a subclass of ``ImportError``) is reserved for a
module/package that cannot be found at all. :func:`_is_missing_bundle_module`
keys on exactly that split: a ``ModuleNotFoundError`` naming the bundle's
own package (or a submodule of it) is the cold-install shape
(``_MODULE_MISSING_REMEDIATION``); a plain ``ImportError`` naming the same
is a genuine code defect (:func:`_is_genuine_bundle_module_defect`,
``_GENUINE_DEFECT_REMEDIATION``) that no re-fetch of identical source can
repair.

That self-healing allowance is intentionally disabled for strict
diagnostics. ``doctor``/``--dry-run`` must describe what is verifiably
ready *now*, and an explicit model override must be rejected before
alternate-screen takeover when its provider cannot even be imported.
Those bounded strict paths therefore fail an inconclusive transitive
dependency import with an installation remediation; ordinary launches
retain the self-healing behavior above.

Never leak a secret
--------------------
This module never logs or echoes a credential VALUE. Credential checks
report only environment variable NAMES + a presence boolean
(:func:`_check_credentials`). Any arbitrary text from provider-raised
exceptions is scrubbed of config values that look like secrets
(:func:`_secret_values` / :func:`_scrub`) before it can reach a
:class:`ProviderVerification.error`, which is the only thing that ever
reaches a log line, the plain-terminal failure notice, or the
``--dry-run`` report.
