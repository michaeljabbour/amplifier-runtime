"""Durable persistence for :class:`AttentionRecord` state (B7 gap 1).

``ui.notifications.AttentionCenter`` used to keep its dedupe/acknowledgement
bookkeeping in plain in-memory dicts: a second process pointed at the same
session directory could never observe another's attention state, and a
restart lost it outright. This module is the durable half, following the
EXACT idiom :mod:`kernel.session_control` already established for
``control.json`` -- atomic tmp-write + ``os.replace``, guarded by the SAME
``kernel.file_lock`` O_EXCL lock with stale-lock breaking -- rather than
inventing a second persistence mechanism.

Layering (ADR-0007): pure ``kernel/`` logic over the filesystem, no Textual,
no amplifier-core, no dependency on :mod:`ui.notifications` (the ui layer
depends on kernel, never the reverse) -- :class:`AttentionRow` is a
deliberately plain mirror of ``AttentionRecord``'s fields, not an import of
the ui-side dataclass.

Non-blocking by design: :func:`kernel.file_lock.locked` is given a SHORT
timeout here (a fraction of session_control's 5s default) because a
notification must never stall the UI. Unlike a replace-only writer, the
dedupe and acknowledgement operations are read-modify-write transactions:
they check the helper's acquisition result and fail closed rather than run
unlocked. Every public method also never raises: a read failure returns empty
state and a mutation failure returns ``None`` -- a persistence problem must
never block or crash the session, and a stale writer must never overwrite a
newer acknowledgement.
