"""THE event contract: raw amplifier hook payloads → typed ``UIEvent``s.

All amplifier-core events are normalized at exactly this one boundary
(ADR-0007). Both channels are consumed and kept independent:

- **Channel A** (live deltas, ad-hoc provider events):
  ``llm:stream_block_start/delta/end``, ``llm:stream_aborted``.
- **Channel B** (durable records, orchestrator events): ``tool:pre/post/
  error``, ``content_block:start/end``, ``orchestrator:complete``, and the
  Attractor ``pipeline:*`` graph lifecycle.

Never reconstruct one channel from the other. Tool correlation is by
``tool_call_id`` only — never ``tool_name`` (parallel calls of the same
tool run concurrently).

This module is intentionally **pure**: dict in, pydantic model out. It
imports neither amplifier-core nor Textual, so the whole contract is
testable with nothing but pydantic installed. :func:`normalize` absorbs
the payload variance documented in RESEARCH-BRIEF §2:

- delta text under ``delta`` | ``text`` | ``content``;
- ``task:agent_spawned``/``task:agent_completed`` vs the legacy
  ``task:spawned``/``task:completed`` names;
- tool results under ``result`` vs ``tool_response``;
- provider usage flat or nested under ``usage``, with cache counters
  under ``cache_read_input_tokens``/``cache_read`` etc.

Every event carries the envelope ``{event_id, session_id, parent_id,
ts}``. ``session_id``/``parent_id`` come from the payload (stamped by
``hooks.set_default_fields``) and are the entire lane-routing key.

    half of the append-only contract.

    Turns are renumbered implicitly by position, so nested and repeated
    rewinds compose: each marker's ``kept_turns`` counts the turns that
    already survived earlier markers, exactly as the live ledger counted
    them when the marker was written. Events before the first prompt
    (session-start preamble) are always kept; the markers themselves are
    dropped from the result. :class:`UnsupportedBlock` placeholders carry
    no turn semantics of their own — they simply ride along inside
    whichever turn (or the preamble) they were interleaved with.
