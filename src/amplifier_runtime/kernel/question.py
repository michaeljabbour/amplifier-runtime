"""Host-provided ``question`` tool: ask the USER without freezing Auto mode.

Re-expression (behavior only, no opencode TS vendored) of opencode's
``question`` tool. The model calls it to ask the user one or more structured
questions (multiple-choice ± free text).  Interactive modes pause until the
user answers and return those answers as the tool result.  Auto mode parks the
questions and returns immediately, so the model can continue independent work;
an answer is injected at a later provider boundary through the existing
needs-you/steering bridge.

Routing (the point of this slice): the tool goes through the EXISTING
deferred-decision / needs-you plumbing so BOTH clients (the in-process Textual
TUI and any protocol/Rust front-end) get the UX via the SAME path they already
speak -- no new protocol op, ``kernel/serve.py`` untouched:

- ask   -> :meth:`NeedsYouQueue.defer` (fires ``RealRuntime._decision_deferred``
           -> ``Notification(level="decision", ...)`` the clients already render)
- reply -> :meth:`NeedsYouQueue.answer` -- the SAME entry point ``serve.py``'s
           ``{"op":"decision"}`` op and the TUI's ``app_support.apply_decision``
           both call
- outside Auto, the tool BLOCKS in :meth:`execute` until every deferred question
  is answered (or dismissed), then consumes each answer so the
  ``StepBoundaryBridge`` never re-injects it;
- in Auto, the tool returns a successful "deferred" result immediately and
  leaves each item pending.  Work continues, and a later answer is injected by
  ``StepBoundaryBridge`` exactly once.

Cancellation (app philosophy -- deny-and-continue, replacing the donor's
``Effect.orDie``): a dismissed question resolves to ``"Unanswered"`` and the turn
proceeds; it never halts. An interrupted turn cancels the ``execute`` task at the
``await`` and the listener is removed in ``finally``.

Layering (ADR-0007): ``kernel/`` is the only layer allowed to import
amplifier-core. This satisfies the amplifier_core Tool protocol
(``name`` / ``description`` / ``input_schema`` / ``execute``) exactly like
``kernel/bundle_summon.py``'s ``LoadBundleTool`` and mounts onto the live
coordinator's ``tools`` point the same way.
