"""Runtime-path ``@mention`` expansion (issue #48 gene-transfer from app-cli).

Decision -- **expand**, not autocomplete-only. Composer ``@file`` autocomplete
(``kernel/file_mentions.py``) only helps the user *type* a token; the model
never sees the referenced content. amplifier-app-cli has always inlined mention
content in its runtime path, so this closes a real capability gap and restores
cli parity. We re-express it the amplifier-native way: reuse
``amplifier_foundation.mentions`` primitives directly rather than vendoring the
app-cli construct.

Donor construct (READ-ONLY reference, never imported):
  - ``amplifier_app_cli/main.py:_process_runtime_mentions`` -- the submit-time
    hook that reads the ``mention_resolver`` capability and calls foundation's
    ``expand_mentions_in_instruction`` before ``session.execute``.
  - ``amplifier_app_cli/lib/mention_loading/app_resolver.py:AppMentionResolver``
    -- app *policy* (``@user:``/``@project:``/``@~/`` shortcuts, ``..`` guard).
  - Mechanism lives in foundation: ``amplifier_foundation.mentions``
    (``expand_mentions_in_instruction``, ``BaseMentionResolver``,
    ``ContentDeduplicator``, ``parse_mentions``).

Behavioral contract inherited from foundation (documented so callers can rely
on it without re-reading the library):
  - Parse: ``@``-prefixed tokens ``[A-Za-z0-9_:./~-]+``; e-mail addresses,
    inline code and fenced code blocks are excluded.
  - Resolve: ``@bundle:name`` -> bundle context path; ``@path`` -> base_path/path
    (with a ``.md`` fallback -- this is how *agent* mentions resolve to an agent
    definition file); ``@~/path`` -> home. Missing paths resolve to ``None`` and
    are silently skipped (opportunistic).
  - Load: files are read; directories become a bounded listing; content is
    de-duplicated by SHA-256; nested mentions are followed to depth 3.
  - Expand: resolved content is prepended as ``<context_file paths="...">`` XML
    blocks; the original text (and its ``@mentions``) is preserved verbatim as
    semantic references. Text with no resolvable mentions is returned unchanged.

tui-native policy this module ADDS over the donor: **size bounds**. The
foundation loader has no ceiling -- an ``@node_modules`` or a multi-megabyte log
would be inlined whole. A stateful :class:`_BoundingResolver` stats each
resolved path *before* the loader reads it and drops any mention that would
breach the per-file cap, the cumulative byte budget, or the file count, so
foundation's expansion runs unchanged while the injected context stays bounded
(cf. the 32-item/32KB SteeringQueue bound, ADR-0007 Steering).
