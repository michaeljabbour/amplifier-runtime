"""E1 consumption seam: an authenticated principal mapped onto a B6 ``Actor``.

**E1 is not built here.** ``kernel/session_authz.py`` owns the authorization
policy (who the connecting party is, and which of ``read``/``write``/
``control`` they hold); this module is the ambient layer's *consumer* of it.
The split matters: a channel that mints its own credential is not a
credential, so the ambient layer deliberately holds no policy -- it accepts a
principal someone else established and maps it onto the attribution record B6
already writes.

Two behaviours, both of them load-bearing:

**1. Consume if present, degrade cleanly if absent.** ``session_authz`` is
imported lazily and optionally. When it exists, a real ``Principal`` flows
through unchanged. When it does not, :class:`LocalPrincipal` stands in with
``verified=False`` and ``method="local-pipe"`` -- the honest description of
what a local pipe actually establishes -- rather than pretending to an
authentication that did not happen.

**2. An unverified networked principal may not claim to be human.** B6's
takeover rule (``human`` 2 > ``automation`` 1 > ``unknown`` 0,
``kernel/session_control.py``) is a courtesy over a local pipe whose peer the
OS established. Over a channel it is a privilege boundary: an adapter that
can assert ``kind:"human"`` can seize the write lease out from under a real
person's automation. :func:`actor_for` therefore downgrades an unverified
``human`` claim to ``unknown`` unless it arrived over a trusted local
transport -- and says so in the returned provenance, so the downgrade is
visible in the audit trail rather than silent.

The provenance dict :func:`auth_provenance` returns is carried in the audit
``detail`` of every ambient entry. Once ``session_authz`` lands, ``Actor``
gains a native ``auth`` block and this becomes redundant *there* -- but the
detail is additive either way, so nothing has to be un-built.
