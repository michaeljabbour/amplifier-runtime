"""E2 -- the permission-grant store, and the ``source.*`` / ``grant.*`` audit.

> **AC4** -- "Cross-context access is explicit, permissioned, attributable, and
> limited to the sources the user enabled."

A grant is a **record**, not a setting. It names one principal, one scope, one
verb and one narrowing selector, and it is the only thing that authorizes
cross-context access. Four rules carry the whole design:

1. **Default deny.** No grant, no access -- and the refusal is *surfaced*
   (:class:`GrantDecision` always carries a reason), never silently skipped.
   An ambient assistant that quietly omits a source the user believed was
   connected is worse than one that says "I can't see your mail."
2. **Consulted at use, never cached.** :meth:`GrantStore.authorize` re-reads
   ``grants.json`` from disk on **every** call. This class deliberately holds
   no in-memory grant cache, because a cached grant is a revoke that didn't
   happen: a revoke must fail the very next read, including mid-turn and
   including one issued by a different process.
3. **No wildcards.** A ``source:*`` grant with no selector is invalid at
   creation, not treated as "everything". ``read`` never implies ``send``.
4. **First-party minting only.** A voice channel may *request* a grant; it may
   never create one (:data:`FIRST_PARTY_SURFACES`). A permission escalation is
   the one action where a channel's own weakness -- lossy ASR, an unattended
   room, a replayed recording -- is exactly the attack.

Storage mirrors B6's proven pattern rather than inventing one: an atomic
snapshot plus an append-only trail, written under the shared
:func:`kernel.file_lock.locked` ``O_EXCL`` discipline::

    ~/.amplifier/ambient/
        grants.json          # current grants (atomic write under the lock)
        grants-audit.jsonl   # append-only: created / revoked / expired / denied

Grants are **per-user, not per-session** (a mail grant naturally spans
sessions), but every *use* is additionally attributed into the consuming
session's own ``control-audit.jsonl`` via
:func:`amplifier_runtime.kernel.session_control.SessionControl.note_ambient`,
so a session's trail stays a complete account of what was done on its behalf.

    ``grant_id`` in the detail. That is what makes AC4's "attributable" real
    rather than aspirational: "which grant authorized this" is answerable
    after the fact, from the same trail that already holds session control.

    *control* may be ``None`` (an ambient check with no session yet); the
    grant-side audit still happens, only the session-side attribution is
    skipped.
