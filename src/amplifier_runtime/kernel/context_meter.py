"""Live context/cost telemetry for the ``serve`` protocol (the HUD meter row).

Backend counterpart of the opencode sidebar-context panel: it packages the three
numbers a context/cost HUD renders — context **tokens used**, **% of the context
window**, and running **$ spent** — into ONE ``context.state`` snapshot a protocol
client can consume without re-deriving them from the raw usage stream.

Every number comes from a source the in-process TUI already trusts; none is
fabricated (mirrors ``.ai/oc_donor.md``):

- **tokens (context occupancy)** — the MOST RECENT root
  :class:`~amplifier_runtime.kernel.events.ProviderResponseUsage` event's
  gross prompt plus response/cache-creation tokens
  (``input + output + cache_write``; cache reads are already inside input).
  Native root compaction can also supply the request-view estimate. This is the donor
  panel's ``last.tokens.*`` sum: a snapshot of how full the context is *after the
  latest provider response*, NOT a session-wide accumulation.
- **cost** — a :class:`~amplifier_runtime.kernel.cost.CostTracker` over the same
  usage events, i.e. the exact pricing math the footer/reducer use. Its
  ``session_cost`` already includes any resume-seeded prior spend and its
  ``unpriced`` count drives the ``~$`` floor marker (never lie in the footer).
- **window (the ``%`` denominator)** — learned from native root compaction's
  provider-derived ``budget`` when available, else supplied by the caller from
  ``compaction.max_tokens`` as a configured fallback. When no window is known the
  percentage is ``null`` — never guessed (donor
  ``model.limit.context ? … : null`` parity).
