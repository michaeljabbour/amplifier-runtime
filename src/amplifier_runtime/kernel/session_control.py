"""Session control plane: durable handle, single-writer lease, takeover, audit.

``kernel/serve.py`` externalizes a session as a bidirectional JSONL protocol.
That contract answers *what* can be driven (submit / steer / approve / ...) but
says nothing about **who** may drive it. This module is the missing half: the
ownership semantics that let an automated controller and a human share ONE
live session without stepping on each other.

Five guarantees, all durable on disk so they survive a dropped connection, a
process restart, and a second client attaching from elsewhere:

1. **Session handle** (:class:`SessionHandle`) -- a stable id for a live
   session plus an ``attach_ref`` any process can re-open or attach to.
   Minted once per session directory and re-read thereafter, so a reconnect
   observes the SAME handle it left.
2. **Single-writer lease** (:class:`Lease`) -- at most one holder may submit
   input. Acquire -> heartbeat -> release, with a TTL so a holder that dies
   silently cannot lock the session forever (the AC5 backstop). Every grant
   bumps ``epoch`` and mints a fresh ``lease_id``, so a stale holder's writes
   are rejected rather than silently interleaved.
3. **Deterministic takeover** -- a *human* actor may always take the lease from
   an *automation* holder; automation may NEVER take it from a human; a
   same-precedence takeover requires an explicit ``force`` (and only a human
   may force). No timing races, no "last writer wins".
4. **Actor attribution + audit trail** -- every mutating control message names
   an :class:`Actor`; every grant, denial, takeover, pause, handoff, accepted
   write and rejected write appends an entry to ``control-audit.jsonl``.
5. **Idempotency** -- a control op may carry an ``idem`` key; the response
   records are remembered durably, so a retry after a dropped connection
   replays the original answer instead of double-submitting.

Layering (ADR-0007): pure ``kernel/`` logic over the filesystem -- no Textual,
no amplifier-core, no runtime import. Every method is a plain call over a
session directory, so the whole state machine unit-tests against ``tmp_path``
with an injected clock. :mod:`amplifier_runtime.kernel.serve` is one adapter
over it; a Rust client, a phone bridge (item B8) or a tmux attachment are
others.

**Opt-in by design.** ``serve`` materializes the control plane only when a
client actually uses it (a ``lease.*`` / ``session.*`` / ``handoff.*`` op, or
any op carrying ``actor`` / ``lease`` / ``idem``). A client that never sends
those sees the byte-identical legacy protocol and writes no control files.
