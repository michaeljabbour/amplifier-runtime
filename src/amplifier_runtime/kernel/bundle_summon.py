"""Agent-summonable deferred bundles: discovery catalog + a ``load_bundle`` tool.

PR #132 added ``bundle.deferred`` — overlays held back from boot for speed and
composed in-session via the ``/bundle load <name>`` *command*. The gap this
module closes: the **model** had no awareness those overlays exist and could
not summon one when a task needed it. Zero-regret deferral means the agent can
pull a deferred behavior bundle in mid-turn, not just the human.

Two halves, both app-level and both no-ops unless ``bundle.deferred`` is
configured (backward compatible — an unconfigured app injects nothing and
offers no tool):

1. **Discovery** — :func:`build_deferred_catalog` names each held-back overlay
   (registry name if known, else a name derived from its URI) and a one-line
   description read cheaply from the bundle's front matter when it resolves to
   a local file (remote URIs stay offline at boot — deferral must not pay a
   network cost to describe what it deferred). :class:`DeferredCatalogInjector`
   keeps that catalog present as ONE system message in the root context, using
   the same direct-context-edit seam as
   :class:`~amplifier_runtime.kernel.surface_hint.SurfaceHintInjector` (so it
   survives ``/clear`` / compaction and never collides with the steering
   bridge's persistent ``inject_context`` at ``provider:request``).

2. **Summon** — :class:`LoadBundleTool` is a host-provided
   :class:`~amplifier_core.interfaces.Tool` the model can call. Its
   ``execute`` routes straight to the runtime's ``load_deferred_bundle`` seam
   (the same one ``/bundle load`` drives), so a summon composes exactly what a
   manual load does — additive tools/hooks/agents mount live, while single-slot
   modules (providers/orchestrator/context) are reported as *available next
   session start* rather than pretending to hot-swap (foundation's
   ``initialize()`` boundary; the honesty is #132's, reused verbatim through the
   returned detail string).

Everything here is duck-typed over the coordinator's ``mount("tools", …)`` seam
(the exact contract foundation itself uses to mount a Python tool — see
``amplifier_core.loader_grpc``) and a plain ``load`` callback, so it unit-tests
with fakes: no real session, no network.
