"""Workspace file discovery and ranking for composer ``@file`` mentions.

This module owns filesystem access; the Textual layer receives only relative
paths and filtered results. Discovery is deliberately bounded and never
follows symlinks, so opening autocomplete cannot wander outside the project or
stall forever in generated dependency trees.
