"""Attach a SECOND process to a LIVE running session, safely.

``serve --attach <ref>`` used to *resume* the referenced session: it booted a
brand-new :class:`~amplifier_runtime.kernel.runtime.RealRuntime` over the same
session id and claimed the handoff. That attaches to the same session **state**
-- and if the original process was still running, it also produced two live
runtimes appending to one ``ui-events.jsonl``. The lease stops two *clients*
interleaving input; it never stopped two *processes* interleaving transcript.

This module attaches to the live **runtime** instead. The process that owns the
session listens on a Unix domain socket beside the session directory and
advertises it in a durable ``attach.json``; a second process finds that
endpoint and joins as a peer rather than booting a rival runtime. Every record
the owner emits is fanned out to every peer, and every op a peer sends lands in
the owner's own op queue -- so an attached client drives the *same* live
session, with the same lease gate deciding who may write.

The four safety properties, and what each rests on:

**No double-writer.** Exactly one process owns the runtime. Ownership is
claimed under the shared ``O_EXCL`` file lock, and a would-be second owner that
finds a *live* endpoint refuses to boot and attaches instead. One writer to the
ledger, by construction.

**No transcript corruption.** A peer never touches the store. It speaks the
protocol; only the owner's runtime appends events. Follows from the above.

**Deterministic conflict resolution.** Two rules, no timing: *at the process
level*, a live endpoint wins and the newcomer becomes a client; a **stale**
endpoint (owner gone, or socket refusing connections) is broken and the
newcomer becomes the owner -- the same stale-break spirit as the file lock and
lease expiry, so a hard-killed owner can never wedge a session. *At the
participant level*, nothing changes: the existing lease and its takeover
precedence decide who may write.

**Clean detach.** A peer closing its socket removes it from the fan-out and
touches nothing else; the owner keeps running. The owner shutting down unlinks
both the socket and the endpoint file, so the next process sees a clean slate.

Layering (ADR-0007): pure ``kernel/`` -- stdlib asyncio over the filesystem, no
Textual, no amplifier-core, no runtime import. ``AF_UNIX`` is required; where
the platform lacks it (Windows) advertisement is skipped and ``--attach``
degrades to the previous resume-the-session behaviour rather than pretending.
