    Thin wrapper bundle for amplifier-app-tui — the Amplifier full-screen
    Textual TUI. Composes foundation's `anchors` bundle (the amplifier-app-cli
    default: streaming orchestrator, 300k context, standard tool roster with
    tool-delegate subagents, and six bundle-local agents) and overlays only
    what the TUI needs: a default provider so fresh installs boot, tool-mcp,
    tool-team-pulse, and the terminal response contract. The app runtime owns
    ntfy delivery from its durable attention events rather than mounting a
    second raw-completion producer.
    The TUI renders everything itself; printing hooks composed in via
    anchors and the OSC/BEL-writing hooks-notify are suppressed at boot
    by the app kernel (built-in suppression list + the `hooks.suppress`
    setting). hooks-logging mounts natively and owns the canonical
    events.jsonl; the app's UIEvent log lives in ui-events.jsonl.

includes:
  # Anchors is pinned to the Foundation commit reviewed on 2026-08-05. The
  # pinned Foundation dependency now resolves non-tip SHAs by cloning and
  # checking out the commit (cold-cache integration-tested), so the historical
  # @main exception is no longer necessary. Anchors' own descriptors still
  # spell nested sources as @main; kernel/source_lock.py applies the packaged
  # anchors-source-lock.json at both Foundation resolver seams (includes and
  # modules), including source URIs nested in tool configuration.

providers:
  # anchors is provider-agnostic by design; this app hard-fails boot at zero
  # providers, so the wrapper keeps a fallback/default. Keep its priority low
  # enough not to beat user-configured providers such as vLLM/Kimi at priority 1.
  # Reconfigure or add providers via settings `config.providers`.
  # Pinned 2026-08-02 (compliance B9): no release tag exists upstream, so this
  # is the repo's current @main HEAD SHA. Re-resolve via `git ls-remote` / `gh`
  # and bump here + tui.md together.

tools:
  # MCP servers: tool-mcp reads ~/.amplifier/mcp.json (+ ./.amplifier/mcp.json)

  # team-pulse: read-only lens over a team corpus (all GET endpoints). url/key
  # are empty here by design — mount() resolves them from settings or the
  # AMPLIFIER_TEAM_PULSE_URL / _KEY env vars, and is skipped (degraded, not
  # fatal) when unconfigured, so a clean install without a corpus still boots.
  # Pinned 2026-08-02 (compliance B9) to @main's current HEAD SHA (no release

# Amplifier TUI Bundle

This is the app's REAL bundle — `resolve_config()` discovers it by name
(`tui`), loads it via foundation's `load_bundle`, composes any settings
overlays (`bundle.app`), and `prepare()`s it exactly once per app start.

It is a THIN WRAPPER: the session (streaming orchestrator + 300k context),
tool roster (including `tool-delegate` subagents), hooks, and the six
bundle-local agents all come from the composed `anchors` bundle above. This
file overlays only the default provider, two TUI-specific tools, and the
terminal response contract below (which composes alongside anchors'
system.md). Printing hooks and the OSC/BEL-writing `hooks-notify`
composed in via anchors are stripped at boot by the app kernel's
suppressed-hooks mechanism; `hooks-logging` mounts natively (it owns the
canonical `events.jsonl`; the app's UIEvent log is `ui-events.jsonl`),
while the app runtime's stdout-free attention destination consumes only
normalized `attention:recorded` / `attention:acknowledged` events. It no-ops
unless `AMPLIFIER_NTFY_TOPIC` is set and never mounts a second
`orchestrator:complete` notification producer.

A packaged copy ships inside the wheel at
`amplifier_runtime/data/bundles/tui.md` (lowest-precedence search
path); project (`.amplifier/bundles/`) and user (`~/.amplifier/bundles/`)
bundles override it by name.

## Terminal response contract

You are Amplifier, driven through a full-screen terminal UI. Prefer running
tools over speculating. This surface renders a supported Markdown subset:

- Lead with the answer, result, or current blocker.
- Default to short, direct responses with small paragraphs or flat lists.
- Do not repeat the prompt, tool logs, task state, or internal narration that
  the UI already displays.
- Close implementation work with what changed, verification, and any blocker
  or required next action.
- A final answer ends the turn. Never use it to announce future execution.
  If you say you are starting, writing, implementing, or executing, make the
  next tool call in this same turn before replying.
- A plan is not implementation. For an action request, do not stop after a
  plan or after saying what you will do. Run the tools now, or name the exact
  blocker that prevents them from running.
- Delegated output is not proof of completion. Verify the resulting files and
  tests yourself. If a builder returns without executing, retry once with an
  execute-only brief; never present its plan as completed work.
- The delegate tool's old example names may not exist. Choose only an agent
  listed in its live **Available agents** section.
- Do not emit Markdown images. Keep tables to four columns or fewer and lists
  shallow.
- Put layout-sensitive or copyable structured content in language-tagged fenced
  code blocks.
- Expand only when the user asks or correctness requires the detail.
