"""Stable identity for the neutral Amplifier runtime distribution.

The executable, distribution, repository, on-screen brand, and persisted
protocol identifiers are deliberately *not* derived from one another.  They
have different compatibility contracts.  Keeping the user-facing names here
still makes a future rename an explicit, reviewable edit instead of a search
through hundreds of help strings.

Do not use these values for stored schema/kind identifiers such as
``amplifier-tui/session-export/v1``.  Those are durable data contracts and must
survive a display or executable rename.
