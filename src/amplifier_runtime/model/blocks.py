"""The transcript block grammar: every visible transcript element as data.

This is the single vocabulary the transcript renderer understands
(DESIGN-SPEC §3). Blocks are frozen pydantic models — rendering is a pure
function of ``(blocks, width, theme)``. Colors are referenced ONLY by
theme-token *name* (``style_token`` fields naming DESIGN-SPEC §1 tokens);
hex values never appear in block state, so a runtime theme switch is a
repaint, not a rebuild (ADR-0007 resolution 11).

Stable IDs
==========
Every block carries a monotonic string ``id`` minted by :class:`BlockIdAllocator`
(``"b1"``, ``"b2"``, …). IDs are the contract for in-place mutation
(tool-line expand/collapse, live plan updates), click routing (turn rules →
rewind, answers → evidence) and rewind trimming — never reverse
string-matching on rendered text.

Discriminated union
===================
Each block declares a ``kind`` literal; :data:`TranscriptBlock` is the
pydantic discriminated union over ``kind``, so blocks round-trip through
JSON (ui-events.jsonl replay) losslessly.
