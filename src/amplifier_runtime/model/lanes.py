"""Agent lanes: per-subagent state keyed by session id (DESIGN-SPEC §8).

Every amplifier event payload carries ``session_id`` + ``parent_id`` —
that pair is the entire routing key for lanes. The registry tolerates
events arriving before their parent lane exists (``session:start`` can
race ``task:agent_spawned`` — RESEARCH-BRIEF risk 5): a lane registered
with an unknown ``parent_id`` still routes; depth is patched when the
parent appears.

Lane line format: ``  <glyph> <name> · <activity> · <elapsed> · $<cost>``
with glyph/color per state: ``◐`` teal running, ``■`` fg working, ``✔``
dim done, ``!`` orange attention, ``✖`` red error, ``⊘`` red cancelled (D5 AC1
— the error/cancelled glyphs are the SAME ones ``ui/transcript_render.py``'s
``_DELEGATE_GLYPHS`` already uses for the delegate-summary block, so a
lane and its post-turn summary row read consistently).

"""The full lane lifecycle (D5 AC1).

``booting``/``running``/``working`` are ordinary in-flight phases (a
spawned child with no event yet, idle, and mid-tool-call respectively) —
this is the "waiting"/"active" half of the design note's "consistent
active, waiting, blocked, completed, and failed states" ask. ``attention``
is the missing live state: a discrete failure signal (a tool error or failed
tool result), a pending child approval, or a denied/blocked child action
surfaced against a lane that is STILL RUNNING — driven by
``ui/reducer.py``'s ``_track_child_activity`` from the same normalized event
envelope that drives the global approval control (not a parallel flag).
Those signals bypass repaint coalescing as ``kind="error"``/``"attention"``.
``done``/``error``/
``cancelled`` are the three terminal outcomes — :data:`TERMINAL_LANE_STATES`
— replacing the old fold-everything-into-``done`` behavior where a
failure's only trace was free-text activity. ``error``/``cancelled``
mirror ``model.blocks.DelegateState`` verbatim (``ui/reducer.py``'s
``_DelegateRow``/``DelegateSummaryBlock`` already distinguished
success/failure/cancellation for the post-turn summary; lanes now derive
from the SAME signals instead of maintaining a parallel notion — see
``_agent_completed`` and ``_finish_turn``).

Pending approval and blocked are deliberately not extra lifecycle states:
the lane remains active in ``attention`` and its ``activity`` names the exact
latest need (``approval needed · …`` / ``blocked · …``). The normalized
``ApprovalRequired``/``ApprovalGranted``/``ApprovalDenied`` session id selects
the lane; a grant or fresh tool attempt clears it back to active work.

    Two delegates of the same agent (e.g. two ``test-writer`` lanes) render
    byte-identical rows — ambiguous the moment the supervisor tries to tell
    them apart. Every lane whose ``name`` is shared gets a short session-id
    tag appended (``test-writer #a1b2``); uniquely-named lanes are returned
    unchanged. A rare tail collision (two ids ending the same four chars)
    falls back to a stable 1-based ordinal within the group, so the labels
    are always distinct and deterministic in registration order.
