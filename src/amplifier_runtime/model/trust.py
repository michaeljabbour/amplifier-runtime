"""Trust resolution: mode → capability → allow/ask/deny (DESIGN-SPEC §4).

Semantics ported from amplifier-app-cli ``ui/governance.py`` +
``interaction_state.py``, collapsed to the five spec modes:

- **plan** — read-only: reads auto-allow, everything else denied.
- **brainstorm** — no tools: everything denied.
- **chat** — ask everything except reads.
- **build** — auto read/test; ask write/net/spend (and exec, which may
  touch any of those).
- **auto** — auto read/write; other capabilities are *classifier-gated*:
  :func:`resolve` returns ``ask`` with ``classifier_gated=True`` and the
  kernel governance hook routes those through the reasoning-blind
  classifier (deny-and-continue on denial, DESIGN-SPEC §7).

Deny is never a halt: the governance hook converts a ``deny`` decision
into a synthesized tool result + a Blocked transcript block, and the turn
continues (deny-and-continue). :class:`DenialLog` counts denials and
flags escalation at 3 consecutive / 20 total, feeding the needs-you queue.
