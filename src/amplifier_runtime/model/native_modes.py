"""Active native (bundle-composed) modes as an ordered set + precedence rules.

Two independent tool-policy layers coexist in tui:

1. **Posture** — the single shift+tab trust baseline (chat/plan/brainstorm/
   build/auto, :mod:`amplifier_runtime.model.modes` +
   :mod:`amplifier_runtime.model.trust`). What capabilities auto-run/ask/
   deny. Always exactly one.
2. **Native modes** — bundle-composed modes (team-pulse, audit, superpowers,
   …) activated through the mounted ``mode`` tool. Each may declare/imply its
   own tool needs (``safe_tools``).

**Upstream boundary (verified against ``amplifier_module_tool_mode`` +
``amplifier_module_hooks_mode``):** the mode tool and hooks-mode are strictly
*single-slot* — ``coordinator.session_state["active_mode"]`` is one string;
``set`` replaces it, ``clear`` nulls it, and hooks-mode enforces exactly that
one mode's tool policy + instructions. There is no upstream multi-activation.

So tui models an ordered **stack** of active native modes client-side. The
**primary** (most-recently activated, the top of the stack) is what tui
points the upstream single slot at — so its policy + instructions are the ones
hooks-mode actually enforces. The rest of the stack is retained here for
display and precedence; removing the primary promotes the next one back into
the enforced slot. A single active native mode therefore behaves exactly as
the old single-slot ``_native_mode`` did (backward compatible).

**Tool-policy precedence rule.** The posture is the trust baseline; an active
native mode's *declared* tools take precedence over a tool-restrictive posture:

- The kernel governance hook lets a tool the active native mode declares
  ``safe`` through (abstains — ``continue``) regardless of posture, so a
  no-tools posture no longer *silently* nullifies a native mode's own tools.
  hooks-mode remains authoritative for those tools. (This is the "make the
  declared tools survive the posture" half — see
  :class:`amplifier_runtime.kernel.governance_hook.GovernanceHook`.)
- Where a native mode's needs cannot be settled from ``safe_tools`` alone (a
  mode leaning on ``default_action`` rather than an explicit safe list), the
  app surfaces a clear conflict notice — :func:`posture_conflict_notice` —
  instead of a silent denial: "team-pulse active but brainstorm blocks tools —
  /mode build to run them".
